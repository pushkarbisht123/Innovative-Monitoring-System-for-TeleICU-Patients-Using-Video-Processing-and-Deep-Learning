## Innovative Monitoring System for TeleICU Patients Using Video Processing and Deep Learning

### Project Overview

This project aims to develop an innovative monitoring system for TeleICU patients using advanced video processing and deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to reduce the burden on remote healthcare professionals by allowing them to monitor multiple ICU patients simultaneously and efficiently. The system leverages state-of-the-art YOLOv5 for real-time object detection and activity recognition, ensuring timely interventions and improved patient care.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv5 to detect various entities in the ICU, such as doctors, nurses, patients, and family members.
- **Activity Recognition**: Monitors patient activities to detect any signs of discomfort or distress and alerts healthcare staff accordingly.
- **Scalability**: Designed to allow a single remote healthcare professional to monitor five or more patients simultaneously.
- **High Accuracy**: Ensures minimal error margins, which is crucial in a critical care environment.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Processes high-quality video footage in real-time for immediate action.

### Technical Approach

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Compiled a dataset of ICU patient images and videos, including footage from available sources and synthetic data from relevant media.

2. **Video Processing**:
   - Implemented advanced video processing techniques to handle high-quality footage and extract meaningful information.

3. **Deep Learning Model**:
   - Trained a deep learning model using YOLOv5 for object detection and activity recognition.
   - Fine-tuned the model to ensure high accuracy and minimal error margins.

4. **System Integration**:
   - Developed a Python-based system that integrates the deep learning model with real-time video feeds.
   - Implemented alert mechanisms to notify healthcare staff of any detected issues.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TeleICU_Monitoring_System.git
   cd TeleICU_Monitoring_System
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up YOLOv5**:
   - Follow the instructions in the YOLOv5 repository to set up the model: [YOLOv5 GitHub](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)

4. **Run the System**:
   ```bash
   python video_process.py
   ```

### Usage

1. Place your sample video files in the `videos` directory.
2. Adjust the configuration settings in `config.py` as needed.
3. Run the system using the command above.
4. Monitor the output for real-time detection and alerts.

### Outcomes

- **Trained Model**: A deep learning model capable of identifying various entities and activities in ICU settings with high accuracy.
- **Real-time Monitoring System**: An integrated system for real-time video analysis and alert generation.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation on the technical approach, implementation, and results.

### Future Work

- **Enhanced Activity Recognition**: Further improve the accuracy of activity recognition models.
- **Expanded Dataset**: Collect more diverse and extensive datasets for better model training.
- **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to monitor multiple patients seamlessly.
